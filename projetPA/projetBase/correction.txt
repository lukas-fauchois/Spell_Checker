Master Crow perched on a tree,
Was holding a cheese in his beak.
Master Fox attracted by the smell
Said something like this:
Well, Hello Mister Crow!
How pretty you are! How beautiful you seem to me!
I am not lying, if your voice
Is like your plummmage,
You are the phoenix of all the inhabitants of these woods.
At these words, the Crow is overjoyed.
And in order to show off his beautiful voice,
He opens his beak wide, lets his prey fall
The Fox grabs it, and says: My good man,
Learn that every flatterer
Lives at the expense of the one who listens to him.
This lesson, without doubt, is well worth a cheese.
The Crow, ashamed and embarrassed,
Swore, but a little late, that he would not be taken again.
